# Save-links-to-Wayback-Machine
This script saves a bunch of links to https://archive.org/ 
These links are about articles an Indian beaurocrat (Ram Khandekar) wrote on P V Narasimha Rao. (https://www.loksatta.com/author/ram-khandekar/)
Did this because wanted to preserve these memoirs incase Loksatta takes off the pages in the future. 

Inspired by a Tweet from Amit Paranjapre on Twitter
